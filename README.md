## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The primary purpose of this website is to play pong against other players and show everyone how good you are!

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things do you need to install the software, and how to install them.

[git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

[docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/install)

[node](https://nodejs.dev/learn/how-to-install-nodejs)

[nestjs](https://docs.nestjs.com/)

[knex](https://knexjs.org/guide/migrations.html)

[make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

Register a new OAuth application on the [42 intranet](https://profile.intra.42.fr/oauth/applications/new)

Set the Redirect URIs

```
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login
http://localhost/api/v1/auth/login
```

Clone the GitHub repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/42AGV/ft_transcendence.git
```

Change the current working directory to `ft_transcendence`

```shell
cd ft_transcendence
```

Either create a `.env` file in the root directory containing the following environment variables (replace the FORTYTWO_APP_ID and FORTYTWO_APP_SECRET with the ones from the OAuth application you created in the previous step):

> **_NOTE:_**  You can generate UUIDs using the `uuidgen` command

```
FORTYTWO_APP_ID=your-42-app-id
FORTYTWO_APP_SECRET=your-42-app-secret
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret-uuid
MEMCACHED_SECRET=your-memcached-secret-uuid
WEBSITE_OWNER_PASSWORD=your-owner-password
WEBSITE_OWNER_USERNAME=your-owner-username
```

Or export them from the shell like:

```shell
export FORTYTWO_APP_ID=your-42-app-id
export FORTYTWO_APP_SECRET=your-42-app-secret
export SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret-uuid
export MEMCACHED_SECRET=your-memcached-secret-uuid
export WEBSITE_OWNER_PASSWORD=your-owner-password
export WEBSITE_OWNER_USERNAME=your-owner-username
```

Start the application using make

```shell
make all
```

You can now access the web application at http://localhost:3000 and the Swagger documentation for the API at http://localhost:3000/api

Install the node packages required for the web and server application.

```shell
cd transcendence-app
npm ci
cd ../webapp
npm ci
cd ..
```

Some useful commands to see the output logs of the Docker containers

```shell
make log-wa
make log-tr
make log-db
```

> **_NOTE:_**  The logs of the transcendence-app don't include the version in the routes

> **_NOTE:_**  For advanced use cases, you can connect to a service using the Docker container IP and port 

Inspect the containers

```shell
make get-ip
```

Access using the Docker container IP and the service port

After a config file change, please run the following command to recreate the images, renew anonymous volumes and restart the Docker containers

```shell
make re
```

### OpenAPI

We use OpenAPI Generator to autogenerate the files at `webapp/src/shared/generated` from the OpenAPI specifications at `transcendence-app/swagger-spec/swagger-spec.yaml`.

Please don't modify these files manually.

#### generate-openapi

To generate the files, run the following command from the root directory:
```shell
make gen
```

`make gen` creates both yaml file and generated webapp files. To generate only webapp generated files run `make gen-webapp`. To generate only swagger spec run `make spec`.

### Migrate the database schema

We use knex to migrate the database schema, more info [here](https://knexjs.org/guide/migrations.html#migration-cli).

To run the migrations, execute the following command from the root directory:

```shell
make migrate
```

To create a migration, run the following command from the transcendence-app directory (replace `migration_name` with the name you want)

```shell
npx knex migrate:make migration_name
```

### Seed the database

We use knex to seed the database, more info [here](https://knexjs.org/guide/migrations.html#seed-files).

To run seed files, run the following command from the root directory:

```shell
make seed
```

To create a seed file, run the following command from the transcendence-app directory (replace `00X_seed_name` with the name you want)

```shell
npx knex seed:make 00X_seed_name
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Knex executes the seed files in alphabetical order

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Change the working directory to `webapp` or `transcendence-app`

```shell
cd webapp
npm test
npm run test:e2e
```

### And coding style tests

Change the working directory to `webapp` or `transcendence-app` and run style check

```shell
cd transcendence-app
npm run style
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Exploring DB <a name = "tests"></a>

You may want to make some test DB queries when developing. Just go to `localhost:5050` and log in with `admin@admin.com`, `admin` to access the [pg-admin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) client.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

TODO: Add notes about how to use the system.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

This section is for deploying the app on a production system.

> **_NOTE:_**  The application runs on port 80 in the production environment. If another service uses that port, please shut it down before running it.

FORTYTWO_APP_SECRET=your-42-app-secret
FORTYTWO_APP_CALLBACK_URL=http://your-domain-or-ip-here/api/v1/auth/login
POSTGRES_USER=your-postgres-user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-postgres-password
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret-uuid
MEMCACHED_SECRET=your-memcached-secret-uuid
```

Or export them from the shell like:

```shell
export FORTYTWO_APP_ID=your-42-app-id
export FORTYTWO_APP_SECRET=your-42-app-secret
export FORTYTWO_APP_CALLBACK_URL=http://your-domain-or-ip-here/api/v1/auth/login
export POSTGRES_USER=your-postgres-user
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-postgres-password
export SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret-uuid
export MEMCACHED_SECRET=your-memcached-secret-uuid
```

Start the application using make

```shell
make prod
```

You can now access the web application locally at http://localhost and the Swagger documentation for the API at http://localhost/api

## ü§ù Contributing <a name = "contributing"></a>

If you want to contribute to this project you may follow a set of rules.

### 1. Create a new issue or task:

- With every contribution there must be a related issue/task, so if you
don't have any, create a new one on the project board with some
detailed info about what do you want to accomplish.
- Add an appropiate label which describes issue type: `feature`, `bug`,
`task` etc.

### 2. Create a new branch:
   
- ‚ö†Ô∏è We **do not** push to `main`, never. So you'll need to create a branch
to work on it.
- Try to start always from `main` and do not forget to bring
all new changes, preferably with `git pull --rebase` so you don't corrupt
commit history.

### 3. Naming:

- What about branch naming? A good standard way to name could be issue
+ brief description of the task. For example:
`#11/add-contributing-docs`
- We also try to have a **normalized way to name commits**. Because is complicated
to always have great commit messages (despite you should) a good enough 
naming strategy is adding your issue number followd by the message. This way other devs can
keep track of some context of the changes just visiting the related issue
because GitHub will link to it. Try something like:
`#11 / add main contributing points`

### 4. Pull Requests:
    
- When you are ready, you can create a new PR pointing to main. We have defined
two requisites to be able to merge your branch into main:
    - At least **two reviewers approved your changes**
    - You also have **passed all CI checks** (tests, linting etc.)
- In the PR description you should add: `closing #11` (number of related issue) so
when PR gets integrated, issue gets closed automatically
- As with the commits, the ideal is to name it with the issue number followed by a general
description of what is about: `#11 / add contributing documentation`
- Once you pass all these checks, **you are responsible to integrate your changes**.
We have actually two ways: manually or automatically with 
[auto-merge](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/automatically-merging-a-pull-request)
- We've decided to integrate our branches using a `squash` strategy. This let
us to have some freedom when working in our branches. The only requisite is following
`issue_number + short descriptive message` rule in the squash message.
### 5. Conflicts:

- How do I solve conflicts? Most likely, someone merged some commits into `main`
that affect the same files and lines as yours. One of the **cleanest** ways to solve
this is just to update (pull) main in your local and, then, rebase main into
your branch: `git rebase main`. Git will make you solve conflicts one by one,
you just have to follow the instructions!
